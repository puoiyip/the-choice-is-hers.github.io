# The Choice is Hers website
I made an activism website as a part of the Web Development track for the Girls Who Code Pathways program. I've been following the progression of abortion laws across the country ever since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, so I wanted to make a website to inform people of the basics about abortion and why it's so important to have access to it. I used HTML to add all my text, images, and links to my project. I then used CSS to style the text and images from HTML, relying heavily on the flex attributes. I also JavaScript to add interactive buttons for users to learn more facts about abortion and abortion laws. I really struggled with formatting the images the way I wanted them to look, but I was glad that I could change the format of the website based on the size of the screen. I learned the importance of planning ahead and doing research before starting to code, which saved me a lot of time and prevented a burnout and frustration.
